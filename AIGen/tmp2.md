Let's break down this exercise step-by-step.

### (a) Average Power

**The average power of a periodic signal can be calculated directly from its time-domain representation. For a signal x(t) with period T0, the average power Pav is given by:**

- $P_{av} = \frac{1}{T_0} \int_{0}^{T_0} |x(t)|^2 dt$

**In this case, the signal x(t) is:**

- $x(t) = 2 + 4\sin(3\pi t) + 6\cos(8\pi t + \pi /3)$

**To determine the average power, we need to square this expression, integrate over one period, and then divide by the period. Since the sinusoidal components have periods that are divisors of 1 (the period of the constant term), we can integrate over the interval for simplicity:**

- $P_{av} = \int_{0}^{1} [2 + 4\sin(3\pi t) + 6\cos(8\pi t + \pi /3)]^2 dt$

**Expanding the square and using trigonometric identities to simplify the integral, we get:**

- $P_{av} = \int_{0}^{1} [4 + 16\sin^2(3\pi t) + 36\cos^2(8\pi t + \pi /3) + 16\sin(3\pi t) + 24\cos(8\pi t + \pi /3) + 48\sin(3\pi t) \cos(8\pi t + \pi /3)]dt$

**The integrals of the cross terms involving different frequencies will be zero over a full period. The integrals of $\sin^2$ and $\cos^2$ over a full period are equal to 1/2. Therefore, the average power is:**

- $P_{av} = 4 + 16(1/2) + 36(1/2) = \textbf{30}$

### (b) Fundamental Frequency

**The fundamental frequency $\omega_0$ of a periodic signal is the greatest common divisor of the frequencies of its sinusoidal components.**

**In the given signal:**

- $x(t) = 2 + 4\sin(3\pi t) + 6\cos(8\pi t + \pi /3)$

**the frequencies are $3\pi$ and $8\pi$. The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1, so the fundamental frequency is:**

- $\omega_0 = \pi$

### (c) CTFS Coefficients

**The Continuous-Time Fourier Series (CTFS) representation of a periodic signal x(t) is given by:**

- $x(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{jk\omega_0t}$

**where the CTFS coefficients are computed as:**

- $c_k = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0} x(t)e^{-jk\omega_0t}dt$

**The magnitude-phase format of a complex number $c_k = a + jb$ is:**

- $|c_k| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ (Magnitude)
- $\angle c_k = \arctan(b/a)$ (Phase)

**To compute the CTFS coefficients for the signal:**

- $x(t) = 2 + 4\sin(3\pi t) + 6\cos(8\pi t + \pi /3)$

**we can use the Euler's formula to express the sinusoidal terms as complex exponentials:**

- $x(t) = 2 + 2j(e^{j3\pi t} - e^{-j3\pi t}) + 3(e^{j(8\pi t+\pi /3)} + e^{-j(8\pi t+\pi /3)})$

**Comparing this expression with the CTFS synthesis equation, we can identify the non-zero CTFS coefficients:**

- $c_0 = 2$
- $c_3 = 2j$
- $c_{-3} = -2j$
- $c_8 = 3e^{j\pi /3}$
- $c_{-8} = 3e^{-j\pi /3}$

**The magnitude and phase of these coefficients are:**

- $|c_0| = 2$, $\angle c_0 = 0$
- $|c_3| = 2$, $\angle c_3 = \pi/2$
- $|c_{-3}| = 2$, $\angle c_{-3} = -\pi/2$
- $|c_8| = 3$, $\angle c_8 = \pi/3$
- $|c_{-8}| = 3$, $\angle c_{-8} = -\pi/3$

**The power spectrum is given by the squared magnitude of the CTFS coefficients: $|c_k|^2$.**

**To plot the magnitude, phase, and power spectra as a function of $k\omega_0$, we can create a stem plot with the following points:**

- Magnitude: $(0, 2)$, $(3\pi, 2)$, $(-3\pi, 2)$, $(8\pi, 3)$, $(-8\pi, 3)$
- Phase: $(0, 0)$, $(3\pi, \pi/2)$, $(-3\pi, -\pi/2)$, $(8\pi, \pi/3)$, $(-8\pi, -\pi/3)$
- Power: $(0, 4)$, $(3\pi, 4)$, $(-3\pi, 4)$, $(8\pi, 9)$, $(-8\pi, 9)$

### (d) Average Power (Frequency Domain)

**Parseval's relation states that the average power of a periodic signal can also be calculated from its CTFS coefficients:**

- $P_{av} = \sum_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} |c_k|^2$

**Using the CTFS coefficients computed in part (c), the average power is:**

- $P_{av} = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = \textbf{30}$

**This result matches the average power calculated in part (a), verifying Parseval's relation.**
