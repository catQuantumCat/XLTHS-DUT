The CTFS representation of the periodic full-wave rectified signal $x(t) = |cos(10πt)|$ can be determined by calculating the **Fourier series coefficients**, $c_k$. The **fundamental frequency**, $Ω_0$, of the signal is $20π$ because the period of the signal, $T_0$, is $\frac{1}{10}$.

The CTFS coefficients can be calculated using the following equation:

$c_k = \frac{1}{T_0}\int_{T_0}{x(t)e^{-jkΩ_0t}}dt$

For the given signal, this becomes:

$c_k = 10\int_{0.1}^{0}{|cos(10πt)|e^{-jk20πt}}dt$.

After evaluating the integral and simplifying, the CTFS coefficients are given by:

**$c_k = \frac{20}{π(1-4k^2)}$**

The magnitude and phase spectra can be plotted as a function of $kΩ_0$. This information is not included in the sources you provided.
