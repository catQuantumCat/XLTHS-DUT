Let's re-evaluate the original exercise, incorporating the correction we discussed regarding the representation of the sine function using complex exponentials.

### Recalculating the Exercise: CTFS Coefficients and Average Power

The signal we're analysing is:

- $x(t) = 2 + 4\sin(3\pi t) + 6\cos(8\pi t + \pi /3)$

We previously determined:

- **Average Power (Time Domain):** $P_{av} = 30$
- **Fundamental Frequency:** $\omega_0 = \pi$

Now, let's recompute the CTFS coefficients, taking into account the correct expression for the sine function:

1. **Express Sinusoids as Complex Exponentials:** Using Euler's formula and the correction for the sine function, we get:
    
    - $x(t) = 2 + \frac{2}{i}(e^{j3\pi t} - e^{-j3\pi t}) + 3(e^{j(8\pi t + \pi/3)} + e^{-j(8\pi t + \pi/3)})$
2. **Identify CTFS Coefficients:** Comparing this with the CTFS synthesis equation:
    
    - $x(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{jk\omega_0 t}$
    
    we can identify the non-zero coefficients:
    
    - $c_0 = 2$
    - $c_3 = \frac{2}{i} = -2i$ (since 1/i = -i)
    - $c_{-3} = -\frac{2}{i} = 2i$
    - $c_8 = 3e^{j\pi /3}$
    - $c_{-8} = 3e^{-j\pi /3}$
3. **Magnitude and Phase:** The magnitude and phase of these coefficients are:
    
    - $|c_0| = 2$, $\angle c_0 = 0$
    - $|c_3| = 2$, $\angle c_3 = -\pi/2$
    - $|c_{-3}| = 2$, $\angle c_{-3} = \pi/2$
    - $|c_8| = 3$, $\angle c_8 = \pi/3$
    - $|c_{-8}| = 3$, $\angle c_{-8} = -\pi/3$
4. **Average Power (Frequency Domain):** Using Parseval's relation:
    
    - $P_{av} = \sum_{k = -\infty}^{\infty} |c_k|^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = \textbf{30}$

As expected, the average power calculated from the frequency domain matches the average power calculated from the time domain.

**Key Takeaways**

- **Accurate Complex Representation:** The correct use of the formula sin(a) = (e^(ia) - e^(-ia)) / 2i is crucial for accurately representing sinusoidal signals using complex exponentials.
- **CTFS Coefficients:** The CTFS coefficients capture the amplitude and phase information of the sinusoidal components of a periodic signal.
- **Parseval's Relation:** Parseval's relation provides a powerful link between the time-domain and frequency-domain representations of a signal, allowing us to compute the average power from either domain.
- **Signal Analysis:** Understanding the CTFS and its properties is fundamental for analysing and manipulating signals in various applications, including communications, audio processing, and control systems.
