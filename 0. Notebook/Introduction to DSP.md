## About [[Signal|signal]]
![[Signal#^a54b81]]
### Representation
- [[Signal#Mathematical representation|Math]]
- [[Signal#Physical representation|Physic]]
### Classifying signals
Based on Continuity(can be listed)/discreteness (cannot be listed) of: 
- Function
- Independent variable
Types of signal:
- [[Analog signal]]
- [[Discrete signal]]
- [[Digital Signal]] 
#### [[Digitize process]]
Process of converting Analog signal to digital signal
1. Discretizing time axis (sampling) of analog signal
2. Discretizing altitude axis (quantizing altitude using N bit)

## Why DSP?
#### Advantages
- Flexible: re-programming ability
- More reliable
- Smaller, lighter 4 less power
- Easy to use, to develop and test (by using the assistant tools)
- Suitable to sophisticated applications
#### Disadvantages
- [[Aliasing in sampling]]: Solve using [[Định lý lấy mẫu Nyquist - Shannon]]
- Quantization error (limited available bits)
