### Physical representation
*Physical representation of **information***
- **Sound signal** is a physical representation of voices, noises, musical instruments; can be measured (sound loudness) 
- **Image signal**: physically representing environments (light intensity/brightness)

### Mathematical representation
*Functions of **independent variables** (time, distance, position, temperature)*
- **Sound**: func visualizing sound intensity's delta through time: x(t) -> one-way directional signal
	- Mono: single channel - one audio source of a time x(t)
	- Stereo: dual-channel - left/right channel \[xLeft(t), xRight(t)] -> Matrix

- **Static Image**: func visualizing light intensity's delta through time: F(x,y):
	- F: light brightness
	- x, y: coordination in space (2D)
